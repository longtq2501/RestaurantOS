System.Management.Automation.RemoteException
> Build error occurred
Error: Turbopack build failed with 1 errors:
./apps/admin/proxy.ts
Proxy is missing expected function export name
This function is what Next.js runs for every request handled by this proxy (previously called middleware).
System.Management.Automation.RemoteException
Why this happens:
- You are migrating from `middleware` to `proxy`, but haven't updated the exported function.
- The file exists but doesn't export a function.
- The export is not a function (e.g., an object or constant).
- There's a syntax error preventing the export from being recognized.
System.Management.Automation.RemoteException
To fix it:
- Ensure this file has either a default or "proxy" function export.
